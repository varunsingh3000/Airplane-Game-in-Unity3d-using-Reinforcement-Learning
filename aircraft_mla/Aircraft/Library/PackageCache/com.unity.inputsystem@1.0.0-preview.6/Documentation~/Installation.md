# Installation guide

This guide describes how to install and activate the Input System package for your Unity Project.

>__Note__: The new Input System requires Unity 2019.1+ and the .NET 4 runtime. It doesn't work in projects using the old .NET 3.5 runtime.

## Installing the package

To install the new Input System, open Unity's package manager (menu: __Window > Package Manager__). The Input System is in Preview, so to see the package in the package list, select the __Advanced__ dropdown, and enable __Show Preview Packages__.

Select the latest __Input System__ package from the list, then click __Install__.

## Enabling the new input backends

By default, Unity's classic Input Manager is active and support for the new Input System is inactive. This allows existing Unity Projects to keep working as they are.

To fully switch from the old Input Manager to the new Input System for a Project:

1. Open the Player settings (menu: __Edit > Project Settings > Player__).
2. Change Active Input Handling to __Input System Package (New)__ (or __Input System (Preview)__ in Unity 2019.2 or older).

>__Note__: You must restart the Unity Editor before this setting takes effect.

When the new input backends are enabled, the `ENABLE_INPUT_SYSTEM=1` C# `#define` is added to builds. Similarly, when the old input backends are enabled, the `ENABLE_LEGACY_INPUT_MANAGER=1` C# `#define` is added. Because both can be enabled at the same time, it is possible for __both__ defines to be 1 at the same time.
